# Client of our own
CO3 is a free reader app for **Archive of Our Own** (AO3). We built it because other AO3 apps charge money for features that should be free. </br>
The goal is to give you a better reading experience on your phone with features like native AMOLED support, local reading history, and custom categories to organize your stories.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for download links? Go [here](#download).

## Features:
- **Custom library** - Save your favorite works in one place
- **Category management** - Organize your stories however you want (without paying for it)
- **History with filters** - Find works you've read by date
- **Completely free** - No subscriptions, no ads, ever

## Planned features:
- ~~Update notifications when new chapters come out~~ (Done !)
- ~~Bookmarks~~ (Done !)
- ~~View and read comments~~ (Done !)
- ~~User profile pages~~ (Done !)
- ~~Statistics screen~~ (Done !)
- ~~Download works to read offline~~ (Done !)

# Download
We recommend you use F-Droid to install the client, this will allow for auto-updates and alert you if any vulnerabilities are found.

You can get releases [here](https://github.com/tbvns/CO3/releases). </br>
You can get android dev builds [here](https://github.com/tbvns/CO3/actions/workflows/android-build.yml). </br>
You can get IOS dev builds [here](https://github.com/tbvns/CO3/actions/workflows/ios-build.yml).

> [!CAUTION]
> ~~iOS builds are currently untested since none of the contributors have iOS devices. If you’re on iOS, we’d really appreciate any bug reports you can share.
> It is possible that they don't even launch, we really have no idea.~~ Some user reported the app working, athough we don't know how true that is and what remains to be fixed.

## Jailbroken Kindle support
CO3 now includes a Kindle Android flavor with reduced platform dependencies and an e-ink friendly theme.

- Build Kindle debug APK:
  `cd /home/runner/work/CO3/CO3/android && ./gradlew assembleKindleDebug`
- Build Kindle release APK:
  `cd /home/runner/work/CO3/CO3/android && ./gradlew assembleKindleRelease`
- Install the generated APK by sideloading on your jailbroken Kindle.

> [!NOTE]
> This app still follows the project minimum Android API level (24). Older Kindle firmware versions below that API level are not supported by this React Native baseline.
